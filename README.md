# MordOnli

This is a personal project aimed at improving my programming and also allowing me to play Mordheim, a favourite tabletop game, with a friend of mine during the Coronavirus lockdown.

This is still a work in progress.
Points of note:
⦾ Pathfinding, and how to display an efficient path
⦾ Multiplayer implementation on the network end (Both Unity UNET and Photon 2)
⦾ Multiplayer implementation in game, making sure UI and in game elements can only be interacted with by their respective owners except for targeting etc.
⦾ Stop-locking or efficient turn tracking

All rights for the original game to their appropriate owners.
